# Godot integration example using thirdweb's [.NET SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/dotnet/godot)

 In this project, you can find a Godot integration of thirdweb, using thirdweb's .NET SDK.

 This is a lightweight project that consists of a `Scene_Examples` and a couple scripts showcasing [InAppWallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/dotnet/wallets/providers/in-app-wallet) connection flows and some web3 actions.

 You can find the thirdweb top-level initialization script in `ThirdwebManager.cs`, grid button implementations in `ActionGrid.cs`, InAppWallet login functionality in `SendOTP.cs` and `SubmitOTP.cs`. The InAppWallet could easily be passed to a [SmartWallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/dotnet/wallets/providers/account-abstraction) if you want to support gasless transactions.

 Please visit the [.NET SDK documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/dotnet) to learn more about thirdweb APIs, including but not limited to Account Abstraction, RPC, Transaction and Storage functionality.
